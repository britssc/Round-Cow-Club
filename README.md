# Challenge: ATLAS Open Data

## Introduction

### Workgroup
This repository contains a possible solution for one of the twelve challenges proposed in the Latin American Hackaton CoAfina 2024. Said solution was developed by RCC, a group of three physics students from Yachay Tech university. They are:

- Mariannly Marquez
- Britney Robalino Ram√≠rez
- Yorlan Males-Araujo

### Problem
In short, the problem consisted of choosing one (or more) of the notebooks [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata/tree/master/13-TeV-examples/python/), and make the physics and code parts of it accessible for a student that might not necessarily be that familiar with the topics.
